# MIMO_feedback_quantization

This repository will contain the code of an IEEE 802.11 emulator for the evaluation of the impact of beamforming feedback compression through OFDM sub-channel grouping and quantization. The emulator is described in an article under revision. The code and the dataset for the emulation will be release in case of acceptance.
